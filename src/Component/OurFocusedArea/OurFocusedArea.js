                            markets are seeing unprecedented growth but with this rapid expansion comes a more
                            complex and regulated business environment which can be daunting for individual
                            companies.

                            After successful roll out in the region, a business still needs a local strategy to maintain its
                            position and grow market share over time. KadriMedTech Consulting has a number of
                            business continuity services to ensure long term success in the MEA region.

                            We are able to assist in areas such as new Tender proposals, evaluation of agency and
                            distributorship agreements, and local media and marketing support.

                        region and our clients have peace of mind
